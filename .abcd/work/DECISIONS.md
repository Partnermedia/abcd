# DECISIONS

Append-only, one line per decision, newest last. Date-prefixed. Architecture-shaping
decisions graduate to an ADR under [`../development/decisions/adrs/`](../development/decisions/adrs/).
Graduate this file to per-file `decisions/<date>--<slug>.md` if size or
parallel-agent merge contention bites.

- 2026-07-06 — Rebuild abcd from scratch in Go, no external tools (specstory,
  RepoPrompt, flow-next, Ralph, codex); ship an MVP, extend via the companion harness then
  Claude Code.
- 2026-07-06 — Transport-agnostic Go core; CLI is the reliable default front door;
  MCP is an additive front door on the same core, added later.
- 2026-07-06 — Peer with the companion harness via conventions + MCP; no Go dependency either way.
- 2026-07-06 — LLM work host-delegated by default; native/CLI/API/MCP oracles are
  opt-in adapters.
- 2026-07-06 — Spec/task layer native-minimal; the companion harness `ccpm` the primary deeper
  backend; flow-next dropped. Autonomous run not a Ralph port (host orchestrators).
- 2026-07-06 — Single repo, curated release (no dev→public mirror); the repo is the
  marketplace. Private companion repo deferred (trigger: shared transcripts).
- 2026-07-06 — Three-tier `.abcd/` layout: development (durable) / work (shared) /
  .work.local (local). `docs/` user-facing only.
- 2026-07-06 — Module path `github.com/REPPL/abcd-cli`; Cobra approved as the CLI
  framework (matches ferry and the companion harness).
