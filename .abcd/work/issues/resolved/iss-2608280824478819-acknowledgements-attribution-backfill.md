The canonical credit surface is incomplete: design-shaping inspirations fully credited in the committed record never propagated to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md. Backfill set from the 2026-08-28 attribution review: add Inspirations entries for CARL and PAUL (both Kahler, MIT; mechanisms adopted per itd-3 and itd-1), SpecStory (adr-29 seam, specstory-import ships in CLI help), the Karpathy LLM-wiki gist (memory-substrate pattern), gitleaks and TruffleHog (integrated scanners, one self-declared adapted regex), and Dieter Rams; complete the Diataxis entry with the author and CC-BY-SA 4.0; widen the mattpocock entry (ADR three-clause test, PRD shape); add Dell'Acqua et al. 2023 to the CSL references; add source URLs to the Horn and Weng credits and the arXiv id to the Iacob citation; record the mglgit username in the socratic/first-principles research note; fix the dead to-prd deep link in itd-27.
