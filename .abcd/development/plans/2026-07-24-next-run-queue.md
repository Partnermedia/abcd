# Next implementation-run queue (2026-07-24)

**Status:** the backlog for the next autonomous implementation run, consumed by
the generic protocol at
[`2026-07-12-abcd-run-protocol.md`](2026-07-12-abcd-run-protocol.md). This file
supersedes the pick-up role of
[`2026-07-18-next-drain-run-queue.md`](2026-07-18-next-drain-run-queue.md)
(itd-93's readiness gates listed there are now cleared — see the 2026-07-24
DECISIONS.md entries; that file remains the record of why they were gates).

## Run contract

- `backlog:` milestones — the tracks below, in order; each numbered item is a
  milestone whose stable id is its issue/intent id.
- `gate:` `make preflight` (sole deterministic authority); record edits also
  pass `go run ./cmd/record-lint` (0 blockers).
- `budget:` one item per burst; stop cleanly at the first bound reached.
- `commit_trailer:` `Assisted-by: Claude:<model-id>` (kernel format; never
  Co-Authored-By for AI).
- `reviewers:` correctness `abcd:ruthless-reviewer`; security
  `abcd:security-reviewer` on trust-boundary diffs (conservative classifier).
- `strike_limit:` 3 (failed + died entries per item).
- Ledger is capture-only; one PR per item; never merge, never commit to main.

Prioritisation lens (maintainer, 2026-07-24): abcd is designed while being
built — prefer work that speeds abcd's own build loop or gets new
functionality into early dogfooded use.

## STOP conditions (this run)

Hitting one means stop and report, never push through (per the playbook):

1. **itd-93 PRD synthesis ambiguity** — the PRD is synthesised from the
   2026-07-24 grill decisions (DECISIONS.md). If synthesis requires an
   interpretation the grill did not settle, STOP; do not invent the bar.
2. **receipt_gate schema** — iss-122 adds manifest-hash and tier fields to the
   receipt contract. Any change beyond adding those fields (renaming, removing,
   re-gating existing fields) is a STOP.
3. **Missing or ambiguous plan/spec file** — fail closed; never synthesise a
   substitute record.
4. **Any fix ahead of an armed detector** — record the finding first
   (capture-only), then fix behind it.

## Track 1 — loop friction + grill consequences (small, mechanical)

1. **iss-117** — `capture resolve` / `intent seedDraft` gain the `impact`
   field so abcd's own verbs satisfy its own validators. Root-cause class:
   the write paths, not the validators.
2. **iss-115 / iss-120** — one allocator fix for the class: record-id minting
   (`iss-` / `itd-` / `spc-`) must not collide across parallel branches.
   Detectors are armed (see iss-120); fix the class, not the site.
3. **iss-101 / iss-102** — lock the lockless load-modify-write paths
   (history index registerRepo; capture orphan sweep vs commit).
4. **iss-75** — always-latest dev install mode, so the dogfooded binary is
   the tip build.
5. **iss-35 → resolved/** — via `abcd capture resolve`; the graduation gate
   it stayed open for is shipped and armed (decision 2026-07-24).
6. **iss-122** — implement the pinned crosscheck gate: committed input
   manifest under `.abcd/development/release-gate/` (doc list, directions,
   checker count, prompt hash); tiered depth (full for feature/breaking,
   Direction-B shallow for patch); receipt echoes manifest hash + tier;
   receipt_gate refuses on tier/manifest mismatch or undispositioned
   findings — procedural refusal only, findings themselves route to the
   maintainer (verifier-selects-gates-decide).
7. **itd-93 amend + promote** — fold the four settled design decisions into
   the intent (launch sub-verb; self-scaffold parity; built-in rehearsal
   mode; changelog-heading seam), synthesise the PRD from the grill,
   `abcd intent plan itd-93` → planned/, kind standalone, severity minor.
   **Promotion only — implementation is NOT in this run** (feature-class;
   warrants its own focused run per the 2026-07-18 shape note).

## Track 2 — itd-94 record catch-up (the verb already ships)

`abcd intent ready <itd-N>` is implemented and wired (verified 2026-07-24:
exit 0 on a ready intent, exit 1 on a draft; the surface registry row and
`commands/abcd/intent.md` carry it). Remaining work is the record, not code:
run the intent-fidelity review against itd-94's acceptance criteria, close
spc-9, move itd-94 to shipped/. If any criterion is NOT_MET, that finding is
the work item — never re-implement what ships.

## Track 3 — probe hardening, then the itd-88 coverage experiment

1. Walk fixes first, so the experiment's verdicts are trustworthy:
   **iss-111** (open-question marker false positives), **iss-112** (unbounded
   ReadDir), **iss-114** (O(entries×depth) walk), **iss-116** (skip-set
   misses non-Go/Node ecosystems).
2. **itd-88** (spc-3) — the probe/coverage/pack surface substantially ships
   (surface registry rows 2–3, M1–M5); what remains is the EXPERIMENT and the
   record: run probe over abcd-cli itself and at least one foreign repo, read
   the coverage report as the experiment's finding (the packer is built to
   whatever section list survives), then close spc-3 behind the fidelity
   review. M6 remnants (embark press-release interview, asset curation,
   provenance ledger) stay design targets — not this run.

## Queued for the following run (not this one)

- **itd-28** — implement against the 2026-07-24 adapter decision: Stage 2
  through the scanner seam, native default, gitleaks opt-in adapter, engine
  reported loudly, CI gitleaks as backstop; iss-96 pattern parity in scope.
- **itd-93 implementation** — focused run once promoted.
- **Launch chain (itd-66 → itd-65 → itd-72)** — grilled and PRD-ready;
  hardens shipping, exercised once per release; sequenced after the loop
  friction and learning items by the 2026-07-24 lens.

## Also open (recorded so the run sees them)

- Ledger follow-ups from the 2026-07-18 file remain: iss-104, iss-105
  (itd-93-adjacent), iss-106 — drain candidates once triaged.
- New captures from the 2026-07-25 document review: iss-124 (foreign-repo
  review receipts, major — carries two design seeds, needs a maintainer
  grill before implementation), iss-125 (Stage-1 hostname redaction,
  blocked by iss-96). Not queued this run.
- `planned/README.md`'s file listing has drifted from the directory
  (iss-38 class); fix opportunistically when touching that directory.
