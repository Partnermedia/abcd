// expression matcher — and not against Go's RE2. The two languages overlap but do
// not agree, and every disagreement is a silent protection failure in one
// direction or the other: an RE2-only construct (`\d`, `(?i)`, `(?:…)`) is
// accepted by grep as something ELSE and matches nothing, so the entry is inert
// while every surface reports it healthy; an ERE-invalid construct (`[a-z-.]`) is
// refused by grep, so the guard's fail-safe branch blocks EVERY commit while the
// same surface still reports the store healthy. Checking against RE2 detects
// neither.
