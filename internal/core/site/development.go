// The development page — `/record/development/`, sibling to Foundations.
//
// Foundations reads the stores that HOLD: principles, and the intents that
// state a rule rather than ship a change. This reads the stores that MOVE —
// decisions, intents, specs and issues. Where Foundations deals cards, this
// deals LISTS: its stores hold hundreds rather than tens, and a card grid of
// them is a wall to scan instead of an index to read down. A row carries a
// record's id, its date and its title and links that record's own page; it
// never explains, exactly as its sibling never does.
//
// # Why it is grouped and folded
//
// Foundations can deal a store flat because a repository keeps tens of
// principles. This repository keeps ~138 intents, ~40 specs and ~525 issues, and
// a flat deck of 525 cards is a scroll, not a page. The structure that follows
// from the record's own shape is therefore:
//
//   - one panel per store, its note the store's true total;
//   - inside it the lifecycle bar, whose legend names EVERY bucket with its true
//     count — so the page states the whole store as text before it shows one
//     card;
//   - then one list per lifecycle bucket, in `lifecycleRank` order, EVERY one of
//     them folded behind `panelDisclosure`. A store here holds hundreds of
//     records, so a page that opened even one bucket would bury the store below
//     it; folded, the page opens as a column of named, counted headings that
//     states what each store holds before asking anyone to scroll.
//
// The bucket a record is graded by is its own — the directory the store moves it
// between, or the frontmatter status where the store is flat. That is the same
// reading `stateSegments` takes, and the ordering, the colour and the legend all
// come from `segments`, `lifecycleRank` and `segBar` rather than from a second
// copy of them here.
//
// # The cap, and why it cannot be silent
//
// A list is capped at `developmentDeckCap` rows. A cap that hid what it cut
// would publish a partial store as a whole one, so a capped panel's note states
// BOTH figures — how many rows are shown and how many the bucket holds — and
// the bar's legend above it states every bucket's true count whether its list is
// capped or not. Nothing on this page is a number a reader has to trust.
//
// Rows run newest first, by the record's effective date and then by its handle,
// so the cut is always the oldest tail of a bucket and is the same on every
// build.
//
// # What is not here
//
// Principles and disciplines are Foundations' half and are not repeated. The
// issue ledger is working-tier data (adr-32) and is in the export only where the
// repository opts in — so a repository that has not opted in simply has no issue
// nodes, and the store is omitted by the same rule that omits any empty one.
// Graceful absence throughout (itd-140): a store with no records gets no panel,
// and a record with no store to speak of gets no page at all.
