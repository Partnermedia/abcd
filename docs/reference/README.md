# Reference

Information-oriented documentation — dry, accurate descriptions of the machinery:
configuration keys, environment variables, file schemas, and the command reference.

- Hand-written reference pages live directly here; today these are the writing
  style guide and the terminology crosswalk below.
- [`writing-style.md`](writing-style.md): The writing style guide, covering the
  language split, tense, page types, and punctuation rules, each labelled
  machine-enforced or review.
- [`terminology.md`](terminology.md): The terminology crosswalk, mapping
  established agentic-AI terms to abcd's position on each (uses / adapts /
  rejects / watching), every definition cited to a primary source.
- [`cli/`](cli/README.md) is the auto-generated command reference (from the Cobra command
  tree), gated against drift by a build test.
